# Emily Hatten | Personal Portfolio

Hi! I'm Emily, a senior at Furman University pursuing a triple major in Physics, Applied Mathematics, and Information Technology with a minor in Data Analytics. This is the repository for my personal portfolio website.

## About This Project

I built this portfolio to showcase my research experience in computational physics and highlight my technical skills. The site features interactive elements like multilingual greetings, collapsible sections, and hover effects—all built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Live Demo

[View the live site](#) *(https://emilyhattenn.github.io/)*

## Features

- **Animated Greeting** — Cycles through seven languages and adjusts based on time of day
- **Collapsible About Section** — Smooth expand/collapse animation with "Show more/less" toggle
- **Responsive Design** — Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Hover Effects** — Interactive elements throughout the site
- **Back to Top Button** — Appears after scrolling for easy navigation

## Sections

### Welcome
A hero section with my photo, animated multilingual greeting, and a hover-reveal introduction about my academic background and career goals.

### About Me
A collapsible section with my background, research interests, and personal photos. Includes details about my interdisciplinary approach to physics and computing.

### Technical Skills
Three categories of skills organized in a grid layout:

**Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Astropy, SciPy, Scikit Learn, Sympy

**Languages:** Fortran, Python, Java, R, LaTeX, Arduino, PHP, SQL

**Libraries:** Data science and scientific computing libraries for physics research

### Research Experience

**Cataclysmic Variable Star Systems (2024)**
- Analyzed light curves using Python in Jupyter notebooks
- Used SkyNet for neural network classification and AfterGlow for visualization
- Contributed to a published research paper and poster presentation
- *Tools: Python, Astropy, Jupyter, SkyNet, AfterGlow*

**Maxwell's Equations Simulations (2024-2025)**
- Solving Maxwell's equations in 3D space using PSTD and FDTD methods
- Simulating ultrashort laser pulse propagation and nanostructure interactions
- Implementing absorbing boundary conditions (CPML) and total field scatter field injection
- *Tools: Fortran, Igor Pro 8, PSTD/FDTD*

## Running Locally

Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emilyhatten/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
open index.html
```

No build tools or dependencies required.

## Future Plans

**For my career:**
I'm seeking a master's program in Applied Physics or Computational Physics for Fall 2026, with interests in photonics, nanotechnology, or quantum computing. My goal is to pursue a PhD and eventually work in R&D in the tech industry.

**For this portfolio:**
- Add detailed project pages
- Include downloadable resume
- Implement dark mode toggle
- Add navigation menu
